Original processing scripts for Tampa Bay Nekton Index, see [tbeptools](https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools) for working functions.

The data object [fimdata](https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools/reference/fimdata.html) in tbeptools is created from `data/TampaBay_NektonIndexData.csv` which is created in `R/1_Query_FIM_Database.R`.  The R script can only be used by FIM staff with appropriate credentials and is included here for transparency.
